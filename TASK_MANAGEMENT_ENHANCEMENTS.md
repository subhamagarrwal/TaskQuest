# Task Management Feature Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the task management functionality in TaskQuest with edit/delete capabilities and priority-based visual indicators.

## Changes Made

### 1. Task Display Improvements
- **Priority-based Color Coding**: Tasks now display priority levels with color-coded badges:
  - ðŸ”´ **High Priority**: Red background/border
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Priority**: Yellow/Golden background/border  
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Low Priority**: Green background/border
- **Quest Information**: Added quest title display for each task
- **Improved Data Attributes**: Fixed task ID handling for both ObjectId and string formats

### 2. Edit Task Functionality
- **Edit Modal**: Added a comprehensive edit modal for updating task properties
- **Editable Fields**:
  - Task title (required)
  - Task description
  - Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
  - Completion status (Pending/Completed)
- **Data Pre-population**: Edit modal automatically fills with current task data
- **GraphQL Integration**: Uses GraphQL mutations for updating tasks

### 3. Delete Task Functionality
- **Improved Delete**: Enhanced delete functionality with better error handling
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Added confirmation prompt before deletion
- **Loading States**: Button shows "Deleting..." during operation
- **Error Recovery**: Re-enables button if deletion fails

### 4. User Experience Improvements

- **Click Outside**: Click outside modal background to close
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- **File**: `views/partials/tasks.ejs`
  - Added edit task modal HTML
  - Enhanced task display with priority badges
  - Improved JavaScript event handlers

### CSS Updates

  - Added `.task-status-priority` styles
  - Priority-specific color classes:
    - `.priority-high` (red)
    - `.priority-medium` (yellow)
    - `.priority-low` (green)

### GraphQL Integration
- **Uses existing GraphQL mutations**:
  - `updateTask` for editing tasks
  - `deleteTask` for removing tasks
- **Proper ID handling**: Ensures all IDs are strings for GraphQL compatibility
