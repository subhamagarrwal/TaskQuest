# 🧭 TaskQuest: Gamified Team Tasking with WhatsApp Integration

**TaskQuest** transforms team task management into a narrative-driven quest. It's a gamified workflow engine where users complete tasks in structured "quests", earn XP, level up, and receive WhatsApp notifications throughout the journey.

> ⚔️ "Because project management shouldn't feel like paperwork. It should feel like an RPG."
