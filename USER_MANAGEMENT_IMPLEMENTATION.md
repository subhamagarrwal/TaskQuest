# User Management Feature Implementation

## Overview
Transformed the "Manage Users" section in the dashboard from quest management to comprehensive user management with role-based access control and admin privilege enforcement.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Route Enhancement (`index.js`)
- **Added User Data Fetching**: Dashboard now fetches users who share quests with the current user
- **Quest-Based Filtering**: Only shows users who are part of the same quests as the current user
- **Role-based Access**: Both admins and regular users can view team members they work with
- **Data Population**: Users include their assigned quests for better overview
- **Performance Optimization**: Only fetches necessary user fields to reduce load
- **Privacy Protection**: Users cannot see all system users, only teammates

### 2. User Interface Transformation (`views/partials/quests.ejs`)
- **Complete UI Overhaul**: Replaced quest management interface with user management
- **User Display Cards**: Shows comprehensive user information including:
  - Avatar with role-based color coding
  - Username, email, and role badges
  - Quest assignments with visual indicators
  - Join date and activity status
- **Empty State**: "Oops! No Users Assigned" prompt with call-to-action
- **Add User Modal**: Comprehensive form for creating new users

### 3. Role-Based Features
#### **Visual Role Indicators**:
- ðŸ‘‘ **Admin**: Purple gradient avatar and "Admin" badge
- ðŸ‘¤ **User**: Blue gradient avatar and "User" badge

#### **Permission Controls**:
- Only admins can remove other users
- Users cannot remove themselves
- Role selection limited based on current user's role

### 4. GraphQL Client Enhancement (`public/js/graphql-client.js`)
- **Added `createUser` Method**: Creates users via GraphQL with validation
- **Added `deleteUser` Method**: Removes users with proper cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and loading states
- **Type Safety**: Ensures all parameters are properly typed for GraphQL

### 5. Enhanced GraphQL Resolvers (`src/resolvers/resolver.js`)
#### **`createUser` Resolver**:
- **Admin Role Validation**: Prevents users with active quests from becoming admins
- **Conflict Prevention**: Checks for existing users with same email/username
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures
- **ObjectId Serialization**: Proper string conversion for GraphQL responses

#### **`deleteUser` Resolver**:
- **Cascade Cleanup**: Removes user from all quest memberships
- **Task Cleanup**: Deletes all tasks assigned to the user
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures no orphaned references remain
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with meaningful error messages

### 6. User Statistics Dashboard
- **Team Overview**: Total users, admins, regular users, and active quest participants
- **Visual Metrics**: Icon-based statistics for quick insights
- **Real-time Data**: Statistics update automatically based on current user data

## Business Rules Implemented

### Admin Role Restrictions
1. **Cannot Become Admin**: Users assigned to any quests cannot be promoted to admin
2. **Must Leave Quests First**: To become admin, users must be removed from all quests
3. **Role Immutability**: Once created, user roles cannot be changed (enforced by User model)
4. **First User Exception**: The very first user in the system automatically becomes admin

### User Management Permissions
- **Admin Privileges**: Can add new users (both regular and admin), remove other users
- **User Limitations**: Can view team members but cannot modify user data
- **Self-Protection**: Users cannot delete themselves from the interface

### Data Integrity
- **Cascade Deletions**: Removing a user cleans up all related data
- **Quest Cleanup**: User removal automatically updates quest memberships
- **Task Management**: All assigned tasks are cleaned up when user is deleted

### User Filtering and Access Control
- **Quest-Based Filtering**: Users only see teammates who share quests with them
- **Privacy Protection**: No access to users outside of shared quest context
- **Database-Level Security**: Filtering enforced at query level using `{ questsIn: { $in: userQuestIds } }`
- **Edge Case Handling**: Users with no quests only see themselves
- **Performance Optimized**: Single query fetches only relevant users

## User Experience Features

### Modal Interactions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press Escape to close modals
- **Click Outside**: Click outside modal to close
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations

### Visual Design
- **Role-based Colors**: Different gradients for admin vs user avatars
- **Quest Indicators**: Small badges showing which quests users are assigned to
- **Empty States**: Helpful prompts when no users are present
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Error Handling
- **Network Failures**: Graceful handling with user-friendly messages
- **Validation Errors**: Clear feedback for form validation issues
- **GraphQL Errors**: Proper error parsing and display
- **Recovery Options**: Button states restore on failure

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-based**: Modular modal and user card components
- **Event Delegation**: Proper event handling for dynamically generated content
- **State Management**: Local state for modals and form interactions
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling with UI restoration

### Backend Integration
- **GraphQL First**: All operations use GraphQL mutations/queries
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries with proper population
- **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations for data consistency
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Usage Instructions
