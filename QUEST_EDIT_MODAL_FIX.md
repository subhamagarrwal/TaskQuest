# Quest Edit Modal Fix Implementation

## Problem
The "Edit Quest" button in the overview section was not properly opening the quest edit modal popup.

## Root Cause
1. The overview partial didn't have access to quest data (`quests` variable was not passed)
2. The navigation relied on finding an edit button that might not exist
3. No reliable way to pass quest data from overview to quests section

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pass Quest Data to Overview Partial
**File**: `views/dashboard.ejs`
- Updated the overview include to pass `quests` data: `<%- include('partials/overview', { user, tasks, quests }) %>`

### 2. Enhanced Overview Quest Edit Function
**File**: `views/partials/overview.ejs`
- Added conditional display: Only show "Edit Quest" card when quests exist
- Enhanced `openQuestEditFromOverview()` function to:
  - Extract quest data from the available quest (title, description, completionDate, id)
  - Store quest data in sessionStorage as JSON
  - Set flag for modal opening
  - Navigate to quests section
- Added comprehensive debugging and error handling

### 3. Improved Quest Modal Opening Logic
**File**: `views/partials/quests.ejs`
- Enhanced the modal opening detection to:
  - First check for stored quest data from overview
  - Parse and use the stored data to populate modal fields
  - Fallback to original button-clicking logic if no stored data
  - Added comprehensive debugging throughout the process
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks

## Technical Flow

1. **Overview Click**: User clicks "Edit Quest" in overview
2. **Data Preparation**: Function extracts quest data and stores in sessionStorage
3. **Navigation**: Page navigates to `/dashboard?section=quests`
4. **Detection**: Quests section detects the `openQuestEditModal` flag
5. **Data Retrieval**: Gets stored quest data from sessionStorage
6. **Modal Population**: Populates modal fields with quest data
7. **Modal Opening**: Opens the quest edit modal with pre-filled data

## Debugging Features Added

- Console logging at each step to track the process
- Error handling for JSON parsing and data access
- Fallback mechanisms if any step fails
- Clear indication of success/failure states

## Key Files Modified

1. `views/dashboard.ejs` - Pass quests data to overview
2. `views/partials/overview.ejs` - Quest edit function and conditional display
3. `views/partials/quests.ejs` - Enhanced modal opening logic

## Testing Steps

1. Navigate to overview section
2. Click "Edit Quest" button (should only appear when quests exist)
3. Should navigate to quests section and automatically open quest edit modal
4. Modal should be pre-populated with current quest data
5. Check browser console for debugging information

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ "Edit Quest" button only appears when quests exist
- ✅ Clicking opens quest edit modal with current data
- ✅ Modal is pre-populated with title, description, and completion date
- ✅ All existing quest editing functionality preserved
- ✅ Fallback to original logic if stored data fails
